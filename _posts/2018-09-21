so far i believe that the course will be difficut but educational. AP computer science princple will be very
benefitial for the career that i won't. That includes github.com which will help me better organize myself 
in the near future. My biggest problem so far and in general is getting work done on time, in other words 
i'm a procrcinator. This is a problem i must overcome if i wish to exceed expectations and go on to be very
successful in life.
